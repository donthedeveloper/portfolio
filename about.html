    <img class="testPicture" src="http://i.imgur.com/2odJnfI.jpg">
    <p>I am an aspiring web developer. While I am open to projects for freelance work, I am more interested in joining a team of developers - one in which I can collaborate, learn, and grow with. By putting time and energy into creating mutually beneficial relationships, I have successfully managed teams and led departments to financial success in other fields. I would like to share that experience and apply it to a career in web development - a career in which I thought was just a dream until recently.</p>
    <p>For better or worse, I am self-taught. I have no formal training or certifications in web development. Everything I have learned comes from my love for coding and design. I have learned a lot through Treehouse courses and other articles, but I have so much more to learn. That’s what excites me the most. </p>
	  <p>Why am I looking for a full-time position in front-end development? While I’ve always loved the “aha” moments that PHP has given me, I also have a fascination for design. Front-end development lets me grow and become better at design, while also giving me those “aha” moments through object-oriented(yes I know it’s not really object-oriented) programming such as JavaScript.</p>
    <p>Information is beautiful and statistics is a powerful way to show that. Let me show you what my actions say about me.</p>
